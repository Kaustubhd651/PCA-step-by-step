# PCA-step-by-step
In this repository, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of how PCA works without relying on external libraries like scikit-learn. It includes a faithful translation of the mathematical concepts into code and provides clear and informative visualizations to help you grasp the inner workings of PCA.


Certainly, let's analyze the code step by step to understand its implementation of PCA (Principal Component Analysis) without relying on external libraries like scikit-learn. I'll break down each part and explain its purpose:

1. **Data Generation:** The code starts by generating two sets of random data points using NumPy. Each set has 20 samples with three features. These sets represent two classes (1 and 0) with different means but the same covariance matrix.

2. **Dataframe Creation:** The data is organized into Pandas DataFrames, and a 'target' column is added to identify the classes.

3. **Data Visualization:** Plotly Express and Plotly are used to create a 3D scatter plot to visualize the generated data points. The 'target' is used for coloring the points.

4. **Data Standardization:** The data is standardized (mean-centered and scaled to unit variance) using scikit-learn's `StandardScaler`.

5. **Covariance Matrix Calculation:** The code calculates the covariance matrix of the standardized data using NumPy.

6. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors:** It computes the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix using NumPy's `np.linalg.eig` function. These represent the principal components.

7. **3D Plot with Eigenvectors:** Matplotlib is used to create a 3D plot of the data points. The principal components are visualized as red arrows, showing their directions.

8. **Dimensionality Reduction:** The code selects the first two principal components and projects the data onto this reduced-dimensional space using matrix multiplication.

9. **Visualization of Transformed Data:** The transformed data is visualized in a 2D scatter plot using Plotly Express, where the points are colored by class.

In summary, this code generates synthetic data, standardizes it, computes the covariance matrix, finds the principal components (eigenvalues and eigenvectors), and then projects the data onto a lower-dimensional space. It uses visualization to help understand the impact of PCA on the data. This is a simplified example to demonstrate PCA principles without using external libraries dedicated to PCA calculations.
