# PCA-step-by-step
In this repository, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of how PCA works without relying on external libraries like scikit-learn. It includes a faithful translation of the mathematical concepts into code and provides clear and informative visualizations to help you grasp the inner workings of PCA.


Data Preprocessing: Start by loading your dataset and applying any necessary preprocessing steps. This may include centering the data by subtracting the mean from each feature to ensure it has a mean of zero.

Covariance Matrix Calculation: Calculate the covariance matrix of the preprocessed data. The covariance matrix represents the relationships between different features in your dataset.

Eigenvalue and Eigenvector Computation: Compute the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. These eigenvectors will be the principal components, and the eigenvalues represent the variance explained by each component.

Sorting and Selecting Principal Components: Sort the eigenvalues in descending order and select the top-k eigenvectors to retain the most important components. The value of 'k' depends on the desired dimensionality reduction.

Projection: Project your original data onto the selected principal components to obtain the reduced-dimensional representation of your data.

Visualization: Visualize the results to understand how dimensionality reduction has affected the data and how the variance is distributed across the principal components.

Optional: Inverse Transform: If needed, implement an inverse transformation to reconstruct data from the reduced representation back to the original feature space.

By following these steps and translating the mathematical concepts into code, you can create a custom PCA implementation and gain a deeper understanding of how PCA works under the hood.
